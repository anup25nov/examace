# Issues Fixed Summary

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing Mock Test Files (404 Errors)
**Problem**: The system was trying to load mock tests 5-11 that don't exist, causing 404 errors in the console.

**Root Cause**: The `questionLoader.ts` was configured to discover up to 20 mock tests, but only 4 mock test files exist in the system.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `generateMockTestPatterns()` to only generate patterns for existing mock tests (1-4)
- Updated the test configuration in `loadAllQuestionsForExam()` to only include existing mock tests for SSC-CGL

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/questionLoader.ts`

### 2. Statistics Not Being Saved After Test Completion
**Problem**: After completing any test, the exam statistics (set attempted, score, rank) were not being updated or created in the database.

**Root Cause**: Parameter mismatches in Supabase RPC functions:
- `update_exam_stats_properly` function expected 4 parameters but was being called with 3
- `submitindividualtestscore` function had parameters in wrong order

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `update_exam_stats_properly` function to accept the correct parameters: `user_uuid`, `exam_name`, `new_score`
- Fixed the `submitindividualtestscore` function parameter order to match how it's being called
- Added proper conflict resolution with `ON CONFLICT` clauses

**Files Created**:
- `FIX_RPC_FUNCTIONS.sql` - SQL script to fix the RPC functions
- `supabase/migrations/20250103000002_fix_rpc_functions.sql` - Migration file

## How to Apply the Fixes

### For the Missing Files Issue
The fix is already applied in the code. No additional action needed.

### For the Statistics Issue
Run the SQL script `FIX_RPC_FUNCTIONS.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `FIX_RPC_FUNCTIONS.sql`
4. Execute the script

## What the Fixes Do

### Mock Test Discovery Fix
- Prevents the system from trying to load non-existent mock test files
- Eliminates 404 errors in the console
- Only attempts to load mock tests 1-4 which actually exist

### Statistics Saving Fix
- Ensures that when a user completes a test, their statistics are properly saved
- Updates exam stats including total tests, best score, average score, and last test date
- Properly handles individual test scores for ranking purposes
- Uses proper conflict resolution to handle duplicate submissions

## Testing the Fixes

After applying the fixes:

1. **Test Mock Test Loading**: Navigate to SSC-CGL mock tests - you should no longer see 404 errors in the console
2. **Test Statistics Saving**: Complete any test and verify that:
   - The test completion is recorded
   - Exam statistics are updated (total tests, best score, average score)
   - Individual test scores are saved for ranking

## Files Modified Summary

- `src/lib/questionLoader.ts` - Fixed mock test discovery
- `FIX_RPC_FUNCTIONS.sql` - SQL script to fix RPC functions
- `supabase/migrations/20250103000002_fix_rpc_functions.sql` - Migration file
- `supabase/migrations/20250906134952_6aac648b-94d4-4ee7-a5ef-f9233c9e5ec2.sql` - Updated existing migration

The fixes ensure that the exam system works properly without console errors and that user statistics are correctly saved and updated after test completion.
