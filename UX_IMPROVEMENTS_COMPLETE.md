## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Test Details Display Fixed
**Problem**: Test details showed decimal duration (e.g., "60.0000000000001 minutes")
**Solution**: Updated `questionLoader.ts` to show proper format:
- **Before**: `100 questions â€¢ 60.0000000000001 minutes`
- **After**: `100 questions â€¢ 60 minutes â€¢ 200 marks`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/questionLoader.ts` - Updated `getAvailableTests` function

### 2. âœ… Performance Statistics UX Improved
**Problem**: Performance Statistics were left-aligned and not user-friendly
**Solution**: Enhanced the layout and styling:
- **Centered Layout**: Statistics are now center-aligned with better spacing
- **Improved Cards**: Added colored icon backgrounds, better shadows, and hover effects
- **Better Typography**: Larger, bolder text with improved hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Better grid layout for different screen sizes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/ExamDashboard.tsx` - Enhanced Performance Statistics section

### 3. âœ… Daily Streak Styling Enhanced
**Problem**: Daily streak was small and not prominent
**Solution**: Made streak display bigger and bolder:
- **Before**: Small icon (w-3 h-3) and text (text-xs)
- **After**: Larger icon (w-4 h-4) and bold text (text-sm font-bold)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Enhanced streak display in header

### 4. âœ… Overall UX Enhancements
**Problem**: Test cards and buttons needed better visual appeal
**Solution**: Added multiple UX improvements:
- **Test Cards**: Added hover effects, better shadows, and smooth transitions
- **Action Buttons**: Improved button styling with better colors and hover states
- **Visual Feedback**: Added scale effects and border color changes on hover
- **Better Spacing**: Improved padding and margins throughout

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/ExamDashboard.tsx` - Enhanced test card styling and button interactions

### 5. ðŸ”„ Login Flow Analysis
**Current Status**: The login flow logic is already correct and should work as expected:
- âœ… Users with PIN skip OTP and go directly to PIN login
- âœ… Users without PIN get OTP verification
- âœ… "Forgot PIN" option sends OTP for re-verification
- âœ… Daily visit tracking is properly implemented

**Potential Issues**:
- Cache might be interfering with user status detection
- User might not have a PIN set properly in the database
- Network issues might affect the `checkUserStatus` function
