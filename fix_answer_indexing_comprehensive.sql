-- COMPREHENSIVE FIX FOR ANSWER INDEXING ISSUES
-- =====================================================

-- This SQL file documents the answer indexing issues and provides
-- the TypeScript fixes needed in the frontend components.

-- ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-- The SolutionsDisplay component has inconsistent answer indexing logic:
-- 1. Line 613: isCorrectAnswer only checks question.correct, not question.correctAnswerIndex
-- 2. This causes correct answers to not be highlighted properly in the UI
-- 3. Zero-based indexing is used correctly for display (A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3)
-- 4. But the logic for determining which option is correct is inconsistent

-- FRONTEND FIXES NEEDED:
-- 1. Update SolutionsDisplay.tsx line 613
-- 2. Ensure consistent use of correctAnswerIndex vs correct
-- 3. Verify all components use zero-based indexing consistently

-- The actual fixes are in the TypeScript files, not SQL.
-- This file serves as documentation of the issues found.

-- DOCUMENTATION OF ISSUES FOUND
-- =====================================================

-- Issue 1: Inconsistent correct answer detection
-- Location: src/components/SolutionsDisplay.tsx:613
-- Problem: const isCorrectAnswer = question.correct !== undefined && question.correct === optionIndex;
-- Should be: const isCorrectAnswer = (question.correctAnswerIndex !== undefined && question.correctAnswerIndex === optionIndex) || 
--                              (question.correct !== undefined && question.correct === optionIndex);

-- Issue 2: Zero-based indexing is correctly implemented
-- The String.fromCharCode(65 + optionIndex) logic is correct
-- A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3 (zero-based)

-- Issue 3: User answer display is correct
-- Line 693: String.fromCharCode(65 + userAnswer) is correct

-- Issue 4: Correct answer display logic is correct
-- Lines 696-701: The logic for displaying correct answer is correct

-- =====================================================
-- SUMMARY
-- =====================================================

-- The main issue is in the isCorrectAnswer calculation on line 613
-- of SolutionsDisplay.tsx. This needs to be updated to check both
-- correctAnswerIndex and correct fields, similar to how isCorrect
-- is calculated on lines 537-538.

-- All other indexing logic appears to be correct and follows
-- zero-based indexing consistently.
