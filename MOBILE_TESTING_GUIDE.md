## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Swipe Gestures Not Working
**Symptoms:**
- Swipe right doesn't trigger back navigation
- No visual feedback during swipe

**Solutions:**

4. Check for conflicting touch handlers

### Issue 2: Pull-to-Refresh Not Triggering
**Symptoms:**
- Pull down doesn't show refresh indicator
- No data refresh after pull

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're at the top of the page
2. Check if other elements are capturing touch events
3. Verify refresh function is properly implemented
4. Test with different pull distances

### Issue 3: Status Bar Overlap
**Symptoms:**
- Header content hidden behind status bar
- App content cut off at top

**Solutions:**
1. Check Capacitor status bar configuration
2. Verify safe area CSS is applied
3. Test on device with notch
4. Check status bar plugin installation

### Issue 4: Text Wrapping Issues
**Symptoms:**
- "Step 2 Sarkari" displays in multiple lines
- Text doesn't scale properly

**Solutions:**
1. Check `whitespace-nowrap` class is applied
2. Verify responsive text sizing
3. Test on different screen sizes
4. Check CSS media queries

## üìä Performance Testing

### Gesture Responsiveness

- **Event Listeners**: No memory leaks
- **State Management**: Efficient state updates

### Battery Impact
- **Touch Events**: Minimal battery drain
- **Animations**: Hardware-accelerated
- **Background Processing**: Minimal CPU usage

## üéØ User Experience Testing

### Gesture Discoverability
- **First-time Users**: Gestures should be intuitive
