# Supabase Connection Fix Guide

## Issue
The error indicates a Supabase connection problem:
```
unexpected unban status 400: {"message":"ipv4_addresses: Expected array, received null"}
failed to connect as temp role: failed to connect to `host=aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com user=cli_login_postgres.talvssmwnsfotoutjlhd database=postgres`: dial error (dial tcp 13.200.110.68:6543: connect: connection refused)
```

## Solutions

### 1. Check Supabase Project Status
- Go to your Supabase dashboard
- Check if your project is active and not paused
- Verify the project URL and API keys

### 2. Update Supabase CLI
```bash
npm install -g @supabase/cli@latest
```

### 3. Re-authenticate
```bash
npx supabase login
```

### 4. Check Project Configuration
```bash
npx supabase status
```

### 5. Try Alternative Connection Methods
```bash
# Try with different flags
npx supabase db push --include-all --debug

# Or try without --include-all
npx supabase db push
```

### 6. Check Network/Firewall
- Ensure your network allows connections to Supabase
- Check if you're behind a corporate firewall
- Try from a different network

### 7. Reset Supabase Configuration
```bash
# Remove and re-link project
npx supabase unlink
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

## Temporary Workaround
The `unifiedPaymentService.ts` has been updated to handle connection issues gracefully:
- Falls back to default payment plans when database is unavailable
- Continues payment processing even if membership creation fails
- Provides connection status monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Try the solutions above
2. If connection issues persist, the payment system will work with default plans
3. Database migrations can be applied later when connection is restored
