# All Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

## Issue 1: Fixed Ambiguous Column Reference in Streak Function

### Problem:
```
Error getting user streak: {code: '42702', details: 'It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.', hint: null, message: 'column reference "user_id" is ambiguous'}
```

### Solution:
Created a fixed version of the `get_or_create_user_streak` function with explicit table aliases to resolve the ambiguous column reference.

**Files Created:**
- `FIX_STREAK_AMBIGUOUS.sql` - SQL script to fix the streak function

**Fix Applied:**
- Added explicit table alias `us` in the SELECT statement
- Ensured all column references are properly qualified
- Maintained the same functionality while fixing the ambiguity

## Issue 2: Added OTP Resend Functionality with 60-Second Timer

### Problem:
Users couldn't resend OTP if they didn't receive it, leading to poor user experience.

### Solution:
Implemented a comprehensive OTP resend system with:
- **60-second countdown timer** before resend is allowed
- **Visual timer display** showing remaining seconds
- **Resend button** that becomes active after timer expires
- **Proper error handling** for resend failures

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/auth/SupabaseAuthFlow.tsx` - Added resend functionality

**Features Added:**
- Timer state management with `resendTimer` and `canResend`
- Automatic timer countdown with `useEffect`
- `handleResendOTP` function for resending OTP
- UI updates showing timer or resend button
- Proper loading states and error handling

**User Experience:**
- Shows "Resend OTP in 60s" countdown
- Button becomes "Resend OTP" when timer expires
- Prevents spam by enforcing 60-second cooldown
- Maintains user context and email

## Issue 3: Restored Subject-wise Filters on Test Screen

### Problem:
Subject-wise filters were not showing on the test screen due to incorrect variable reference.

### Solution:
Fixed the condition that determines when to show subject filters by using the correct variable.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/TestInterface.tsx` - Fixed filter display condition

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed condition from `testType === 'mock'` to `actualTestType === 'mock'`
- This ensures filters show for Mock and PYQ tests regardless of URL structure
- Subject filters now properly display with:
  - "All" button showing total question count
  - Individual subject buttons with question counts
  - Proper subject labels (Maths, Reasoning, etc.)
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Issue 4: Enhanced Language Selection with Detailed Mock Test Instructions

### Problem:
Language selection was basic and didn't provide detailed instructions for mock tests.

### Solution:
Enhanced the LanguageSelector component to show comprehensive test instructions for mock tests.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/LanguageSelector.tsx` - Added detailed instructions
- `src/pages/TestInterface.tsx` - Pass test data to LanguageSelector

**Features Added:**
- **Detailed Test Instructions** for mock tests including:
  - Total Questions count
  - Test Duration in minutes
  - Total Marks available
  - Negative marking information
  - Navigation instructions
  - Flagging system explanation
  - Submission process details

**Visual Design:**
- Blue-themed instruction box with clear typography
- Bullet-point format for easy reading
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Only shows for mock tests (not practice tests)
