# Test Completion Tracking Fix

## Problem Identified

The `is_test_completed` API was returning `false` even after a test was completed because of a mismatch between the database unique constraint and the upsert conflict resolution.

## Root Cause

The `test_completions` table has a unique constraint on:
```sql
UNIQUE(user_id, exam_id, test_type, test_id, topic_id)
```

But the `submitTestCompletion` function was using an incomplete conflict resolution:
```javascript
onConflict: 'user_id,exam_id,test_type,test_id'  // Missing topic_id!
```

This caused the upsert to fail silently or not work as expected, so test completions weren't being properly stored.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the Conflict Resolution
Updated the `onConflict` clause in `src/lib/supabaseStats.ts` to include all constraint columns:

```javascript
onConflict: 'user_id,exam_id,test_type,test_id,topic_id'
```

### 2. Files Modified
- `src/lib/supabaseStats.ts` - Fixed the upsert conflict resolution
- `FIX_RPC_FUNCTIONS.sql` - Added note about the constraint

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clear any existing test completion data** (optional):
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM test_completions WHERE exam_id = 'ssc-cgl' AND test_type = 'mock' AND test_id = 'mock-test-3';
   ```

2. **Take mock test 3 again** and complete it

3. **Check if completion is stored**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM test_completions 
   WHERE exam_id = 'ssc-cgl' 
     AND test_type = 'mock' 
     AND test_id = 'mock-test-3';
   ```

4. **Test the is_test_completed function**:
   ```sql
   SELECT is_test_completed(
     'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid,
     'ssc-cgl',
     'mock', 
     'mock-test-3',
     NULL
   );
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- When you complete mock test 3, the completion should be properly stored in the database
- The `is_test_completed` API should return `true` for that test
- The test should show as completed in the dashboard
- Subsequent attempts to take the same test should show it as already completed

## Additional Notes

- The fix ensures that test completions are properly tracked with all required fields
- The unique constraint prevents duplicate completions for the same user/test combination
- The `topic_id` field is included in the constraint to handle practice tests that might have different topics

## Debugging Tools

Use the `DEBUG_TEST_COMPLETION.sql` script to:
- Check what test completions exist in the database
- Test the `is_test_completed` function directly
- Verify table constraints and structure
