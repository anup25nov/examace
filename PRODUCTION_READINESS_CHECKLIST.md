- [ ] Set up rate limiting at infrastructure level

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update UI Components
```bash
# Update TestInterface to use new services
# Update payment components
# Add error boundaries
# Implement image caching
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply schema fixes
supabase db push

# Verify all functions work
# Test payment processing
# Test test submission
```

### Step 3: Test All Scenarios
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
# Test error scenarios
# Test performance
# Test security measures
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Configure production environment
# Deploy application
# Set up monitoring
# Verify all functionality
```
